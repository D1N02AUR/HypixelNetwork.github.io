            <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1">All Minecraft servers operate on a client-server model, where the server hosts the game world and manages player interactions, while players connect to it using the Minecraft client. Ours is no exception.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>Essentially, The server runs on a computer connected to the internet, and it has a public IP address. If, for example, a user wants to connect to the server, then their Minecraft client communicates with the server through the Internet Protocol (IP). When a player wants to join the server, their client sends a connection request to the server's IP address.The server communicates with players using packets. A packet is a unit of data that carries information between the server and the client. Packets can contain information about player movement, block changes, chat messages, and more.<br>
              <br>Our servers are designed to take advantage of multiple processor cores using multithreading. This allows the server to handle multiple tasks concurrently, such as processing player actions, simulating the game world, and managing various plugins or mods.&nbsp;<br>
              <br>For storage,&nbsp; The world is often stored in a data format like Region files, where different chunks or sections of the world are saved in separate files. This storage format enables efficient loading and saving of specific chunks as players explore the world. It also allows for data corruption to be less of a threat as it may only happen on one file and therefore one section rather than the whole server

              <br>Hypixel features a variety of mini-games, each with its unique gameplay mechanics and objectives. Some popular mini-games include Bed Wars, SkyWars, Murder Mystery, Build Battle, SkyBlock, and more. These games often have leaderboards, rewards, and a competitive aspect.<br>
              <br>Hypixel provides players with the ability to create and customize their own housing plot. Players can build and decorate their houses and invite friends to visit.<br>
              <br> Like any Minecraft server, players can chat, form parties, and make friends while playing on Hypixel.<br>
              <br>Hypixel also has a variety of cosmetic items and upgrades available for purchase using in-game currency or real money. These include particle effects, pets, skins, hats, and more.<br>

There is a decent possibility that people will use these servers for more than just gaming, but rather have be more embedded into their daily lives. Possibly, resources such as schooling and education can be transmitted through this technology, as virtual schools with virtual worlds for people to access will become mainstream. Virtual Marketplaces with Virtual locations can be accessed and items can be ordered from them, regardless of the user and the shop's real location</p>
